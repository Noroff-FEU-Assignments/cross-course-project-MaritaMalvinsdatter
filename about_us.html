        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Our first raincoat saw daylight for the first 
            time back in 2003 and the rest is history. We 
            believe that adventures should be for everyone 
            and that's why we make affordable high-quality 
            raincoats so you can go out and never have to 
            worry about a rainy day. Our raincoats are 
            made with recyled plastic from our oceans, and 
            everytime you make a purchase we donate 2%
            of your buy to the non-profit organization 
            The Ocean Cleanup. 
            </p>
        <p>All raincoats comes with a
            5 year warranty, and we will also help you with
            a repair if an accident happens and it's not 
            covered by the warranty. Get in touch with us 
            and we'll help you. 
            </p>
